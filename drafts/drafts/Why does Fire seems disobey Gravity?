#Why Fire burning downward? Does it disobey Gravity?
##Short answer: fire doesn’t really defy gravity — hot gas just gets pushed up harder than gravity pulls it down. 🙂

What you’re seeing is a buoyancy + convection effect, not anti-gravity.

Here’s the clean breakdown, no fluff:

When something burns, it heats the surrounding air.
Hot air expands, so it becomes less dense than the cooler air around it.

Physics rule:
Less-dense fluid in a denser fluid gets pushed upward. That push is called buoyant force (same reason a balloon rises in air or oil floats on water).

So:

• Gravity is still pulling the hot air downward.
• But the surrounding cooler, heavier air pushes it upward more strongly than gravity pulls it down.
• Net result: the flame and smoke move upward.

That upward motion is called convection.

So the flame’s shape and direction are really just this loop:
	1.	Fuel burns → heats air
	2.	Air gets lighter → rises
	3.	Cooler air rushes in from below to replace it
	4.	That fresh oxygen feeds the flame from below
	5.	The cycle repeats

That’s why flames are pointy and vertical — they’re being stretched upward by rising hot gas.

A neat proof that fire does NOT defy gravity:
In microgravity (space station), flames become round balls, not upward-pointing teardrops. No “up”, no convection plume. Same chemistry, different physics.

So bottom line:

Fire looks like it’s defying gravity, but it’s actually obeying gravity perfectly — and exploiting the density differences gravity creates 😌🔥
