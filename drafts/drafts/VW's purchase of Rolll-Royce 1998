#Between Bentley and RR, which one are making more money?
##Here’s the reality check when you strip away the brand mystique and look at hard financial scale and profitability for Bentley vs Rolls-Royce:

Bentley (automotive luxury brand)
Bentley is a boutique luxury carmaker owned by Volkswagen Group. In its latest publicly reported full-year automotive results, Bentley posted about €2.6–€3.2 billion in annual revenue and operating profit in the range of roughly €373–€589 million (depending on year and mix effects). Profit margins are relatively high because of bespoke options and limited volumes.   ￼

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars (automotive luxury brand)
Part of BMW Group, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars on its own is far smaller in volume. Annual car deliveries are around ~5,700–6,000 cars globally (much lower than Bentley’s ~10k+). Independent revenue figures for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars aren’t always reported separately by BMW, but on industry data Rolls-Royce’s automotive revenue and profit are substantially below Bentley’s when you look purely at the car division.   ￼

Looked at from the parent company level
There’s a point some analysis brings up: Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (the aerospace & defence/engine maker) is a huge business with approximately £18.9 billion in revenue and nearly £2.9 billion operating income in 2024. But that’s mostly engines and power systems, not luxury cars. That corporate figure dwarfs Bentley’s revenue, but it isn’t really comparing apples to apples.   ￼

So, bottom line:

If you compare Bentley Motors vs Rolls-Royce Motor Cars as pure automotive luxury brands, Bentley typically generates higher total revenue and profits. It sells roughly double the number of vehicles with higher volume and broader product range, and published profit figures for Bentley’s unit are significantly larger than what’s reported for Rolls-Royce’s car business. Bentley also tends to contribute a bigger share to its parent group’s earnings than Rolls-Royce’s car division does to BMW.   ￼

If you’re factoring in the entire Rolls-Royce Holdings plc aerospace/defense business, then that entity makes far more money and profit than Bentley — but that’s a totally different business, not the luxury car brand.   ￼

In practical terms: for luxury cars specifically, Bentley is financially bigger and more profitable than Rolls-Royce Motor Cars right now. 🚗💼
