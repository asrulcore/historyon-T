# I'm accessing if Volkswagon Purcase on Roll-Royce factory is actually good buy?
##Here’s a practical, results-oriented assessment of whether VW’s acquisition of Rolls-Royce Motors (the car business) and Bentley in 1998/2003 was a smart buy — because it didn’t turn out the way most people expected. 🧠

What VW actually bought

Volkswagen paid around £430 million to acquire Rolls-Royce Motors Ltd from Vickers in 1998. That purchase included the factory in Crewe, the tooling/designs for existing cars, and crucially the Bentley brand. What it didn’t include was the Rolls-Royce name and the RR trademarks — those were owned by Rolls-Royce plc (the aerospace jet-engine company), and they licensed those rights to BMW for about £40 million.  ￼

So Volkswagen ended up running two very valuable assets in that deal:
	•	Bentley Motors and the Crewe production facilities.
	•	Temporary rights to build cars called “Rolls-Royce” until 2002.

From 2003 onward, VW lost the rights to make Rolls-Royce cars — BMW took that — and Volkswagen was left with Bentley only.  ￼

How the brands performed post-split

Bentley, under VW, exploded commercially. They refocused the brand on performance luxury and modernized the lineup, especially with models like the Continental GT and later the Bentayga SUV. Deliveries and profitability climbed significantly; recent figures show Bentley selling more cars and generating higher profits than Rolls-Royce under BMW, and contributing a larger share to its parent’s earnings.  ￼

Rolls-Royce under BMW also succeeded but in a very different niche — ultra-ultra-luxury at very low volumes, with bespoke pricing. It grew steadily and remains profitable, but relative to BMW’s overall business it’s a small contributor — about 1 % of BMW profit vs Bentley around 2 % of VW profit recently.  ￼

Strategic evaluation

If you judge the deal on what VW paid vs what it ended up with, two key practical points stand out:
	1.	VW miscalculated intellectual property risk. They bought the car business but not the brand name. That meant they essentially financed a competitor (BMW) by letting BMW use the name on future cars. That’s a strategic oversight.  ￼
	2.	Bentley turned into a real profit engine. VW invested heavily after the acquisition (about US$1.8–2 billion or more over time) to rejuvenate the brand, and it’s now one of the most successful luxury car makers in terms of growth and margins. So financially, the Bentley piece was a strong outcome.  ￼
	3.	Lose-win dynamic. You might say VW lost Rolls-Royce but won Bentley. That’s true in brand positioning terms — Bentley today is more commercially robust, with higher sales and more profit than Rolls-Royce. But Rolls-Royce remains symbolically stronger and equally successful in its ultra-premium niche.

So was it a good buy?

From a pure return-on-investment and operational standpoint, yes — VW turning Bentley into a vibrant, profitable luxury brand was a strong outcome. From a strategic M&A perspective, no — VW paid full price for the Rolls-Royce business but failed to secure the most important intellectual property (the brand name), meaning the intended crown jewel (Rolls-Royce cars) slipped to BMW. That’s a classic case of an asset purchase where intellectual property value was underestimated.

In corporate jargon, VW’s execution created value on the asset they retained (Bentley), but there was a structural misalignment in the deal design that left a portion of the deal with a competitor. In the long run, that miscalculation cost them the chance to own the highest-status global luxury brand in cars.

Bottom line: Good financial outcomes on Bentley. Less than ideal strategic outcome because the Rolls-Royce name — arguably the most valuable part — went to BMW.
